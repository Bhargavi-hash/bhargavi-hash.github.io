        I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB),
        focusing on scalable web systems, machine learning, and distributed intelligent agents. In the summer of 2025, I
        worked as a Data Analyst at Daily Nexus, where I built automated analytics pipelines and deployed cloud
        dashboards that reached over 28,000 users, driving a 36% increase in engagement. Prior to that, as an R&D Intern
        at Virtual Labs, I developed high-fidelity Linux OS simulations using WebAssembly and JavaScript, integrating an
        AI-powered chatbot to guide 200+ students and helping the platform scale to 11 million users nationwide.
        Earlier, I worked at Pentaprism as a Web Development Intern, where I optimized MERN-stack applications with
        secure JWT-based authentication and automated CI/CD pipelines using Docker and Kubernetes, reducing deployment
        time by 40%.

        I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science at the International Institute of Information Technology, where I
        explored everything from compiler design to operating system kernels. Along the way, I have been an active
        contributor to both academia and practice—presenting at the ACM CompEd Global Conference in 2023 and achieving
        top 10% rankings in Kaggle machine learning competitions. I also mentored high school students in machine
        learning and generative AI as part of the MasterScholar Summer 2025 program, designing projects to make AI
        accessible to beginners.

        As an engineer, I thrive at the intersection of machine learning and large-scale systems, building software that
        is both intelligent and production-grade. I’m driven by a passion for designing tools and platforms that can
        scale securely, perform reliably, and solve real human problems.

        When I’m not immersed in code or debugging a distributed pipeline, I’m usually sketching or painting for my art
        channel SoulfulStrokes, hiking scenic trails around California, reading spiritual literature, or chasing new
        experiences to add to my travel
        log.
