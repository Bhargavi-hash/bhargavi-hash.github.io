        <h3>CoMeT: Towards Code Mixed Machine Translation Using Parallel Monolingual Sentences</h3>
        <p>Generating a machine translation system for English to Hinglish in supervised learning. In
            supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making
            predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. (Here we are making use of
            supervised learning because we are using labelled data so that we can get the entire context
            at the encoder.)

            The translation systems could be used to augment datasets for various Hinglish tasks
            by translating datasets from English to Hinglish</p>

        <h3>Remote Pregnanacy Monitor</h3>
        <p>A mobile application mainly used in retrieving the data stored in Zoho servers and displaying it in the
            frontend and the necessary filtrations are done at the frontend based on user roles. The app is designed
            using
            Flutter, Firebase and Dart, to retrieve and monitor the vitals of pregnant women and push necessary
            reminders
            and appointment scheduling on time</p>
